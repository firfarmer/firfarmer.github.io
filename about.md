In April 2023 I was asked to help out with various computer systems at YWAM Ships Kona [ywamshipskona.org](https://www.ywamshipskona.org/).  This is a blog I'm keeping while I'm here.  I'm keeping a blog for a few different reasons:

* To keep friends and family abreast of my activities
* A place to post photos
* To practice my writing skills
* To later publish a best selling novel using a really good ghost writer who can add a plot and various exciting and death defying interactions that are interspersed with actual events so we can say it is based on true stories
* To then make a movie based on the best selling novel that is based on true stories
* To become a highly requested speaker who gets paid $10,000 for every appearance
* To remember what I did when I start to lose my memory
* To play around with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) a blogging platform written in Ruby
