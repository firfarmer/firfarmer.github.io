I'm Miles and this is my blog.  In April of 2023 I was asked to help out with various computer systems at YWAM Ships Kona [ywamshipskona.org](https://www.ywamshipskona.org/).  YWAM stands for Youth With A Mission.  This is a blog I'm keeping while I'm here.  I'm keeping a blog for a few different reasons:

* To keep friends and family abreast of my activities and to learn more about YWAM Ships
* A place to post photos
* To practice my writing skills
* To later publish a best selling novel using a really good ghost writer who can add a plot and various exciting and death defying interactions that are interspersed with actual events so we can say it is based on true stories
* To then make a movie based on the best selling novel that is based on true stories
* To remember what I did when I start to lose my memory
* To play around with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a blogging platform written in Ruby
