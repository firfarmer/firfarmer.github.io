Easter is why Good Friday is good. God's love was demonstrated through Jesus's death on our behalf followed by his return in a living form.  Christianity is the only religion based on accepting Godâ€™s love and not on our own works.

The day started with a sunrise service that included all churches in Kona meeting down by the ocean.  There were hula dancers followed by scripture readings, worship, and a sermon.  At least 10-15 pastors shared the stage and many hundreds were in attendance.

Then came a brunch at the UN campus which included presentations by some of the students and a sermon about rabbits, eggs, and chocolate that somehow related to Christianity.  Some humor was involved.  Afterwards, I was deemed as too old to collect Easter eggs and thus the kids got all the chocolate.

The rest of the day was spent with my new friends Marlys, Len, Dave, Melinda, and Valerie (not in photo).  We drove north on Queen Kaahumanu Hwy to the end of Kawaihae Rd to Pololu Valley Lookout - about 60 miles.  We made stops in villages along the way and visited the Makapala retreat center that ministers to the local community.  On the way home we stopped at a beach to watch the sunset.  A perfect end to a perfect day.

*[Luk 24:6-7 ESV] 6 He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, 7 that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.*

*[Act 4:33 NIV] 33 With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God's grace was so powerfully at work in them all*

*[1Co 1:18 ESV] 18 For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.*
