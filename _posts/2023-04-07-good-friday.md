The day was full with Good Friday events combined with the arrival of the DTS students.  The day started with a service at Mokuaikaua Church, the oldest church in Hawaii.  The service was held outside on an adjacent patio as the church building is in the process of restoration.  Some of the worship songs were Hawaiian and had a beautiful sound to them.

Later in the evening we caught shuttles up to the UN campus where we had dinner in the large cafeteria.  Everyone eats at the same time so the cafeteria is pretty massive with at least a hundred tables.  And itâ€™s outdoors of course.  I enjoyed dinner with my new friends.

After dinner, we went down to the UN worship center where they had the welcome ceremony.  The ceremony started with multiple Hawaiian dances including a fire dancer.  Then flags were presented for every country represented by the incoming DTS students; over 30 countries in all.  Ukraine got the biggest reception.  The night was capped off by a Good Friday message given by a dynamic young man and then a powerful worship service.   It was a great start to the new school quarter.

*[Isa 53:3-6 ESV] 3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 4 Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned--every one--to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.*
