Kona is the location of the Ironman, the original 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and finishing with a 26.2 mile marathon run. Every October the town is overrun by a few thousand super fit athletes and their supporters running, biking, and swimming and causing a general nuisance for the locals.  The Ironman has grown from its inception in 1978 to a world wide series sanctioned in multiple locations.  However, Kona is the location of the yearly championship and continues to be the most prestigious of the endurance events.

The Ironman swim is in Kailua Bay and starts at the beach across the street.  It had been a while since I’d swam in open water but it seemed like a wonderful idea for a hot sunny day.  The ocean temperature is perfect.  This is paradise after all.  It’s just cold enough to shiver when you first dive in but then the temps are perfect after the first 100 yards.  There are buoys that swimmers can follow.  They serve as mileage markers, one about every 1/4 mile once you’re in the open water.    The water is clear and you can see the bottom for quite a while until the depth is perhaps 20 feet or so.  Sea life consists mostly of smaller tropical fish.  There is a group of spinner dolphins that hang around the bay and periodically come to play with boats and swimmers.

On this swim I noticed my progress was limited to about 1 foot for each stroke.  Was I that out of shape?  Was this evidence I was getting old?  Eventually I realized the tide was coming in and I was swimming against the current.  Although my distance was half what I planned, it was a good workout nonetheless.

The next time I went swimming I looked at the tide chart.  I headed out from shore about 15 minutes before low tide so when I returned the tide was coming in.  More distance, less work, more brains.
