Saturday was another exploration with my new friends Len, Marlys, Dave, Melody and Valerie.  This time we traveled south from Kona about 20-30 miles.  We stopped at an open market on the way.  Lots of fresh fruit and baked goods.  I didn’t find a need to buy anything as the food at the base is plenty sufficient and we had packed our lunches.

On we went to Kealakekua Bay and Manini Beach. There we learned about Captain James Cook who “discovered” Hawaii back in 1779.  Once discovered, Hawaii became a center of commerce for Western trade in the Pacific in the early 1800s and a stop over for whaling ships.  [Homework: read Moby Dick for an overview of the whaling industry].

We broke out the picnic lunch and enjoyed time at the beach.  On the big island sandy beaches are less frequent than lava beaches.  Manini Beach has a sandy place for picnicking with pahoehoe lava flow leading out to the ocean.  Pahoehoe is a smooth, billowy surface compared to the aa lava which is rough and spiny.  The former is easy to navigate whilst the latter is treacherous to walk over.

On the way home we stopped at a thrift store and a Kona coffee plantation.  I was looking for a Hawaiian shirt  but nothing fit my fancy nor my size.  Most seem to be L, XL, and XXL.  The plantation had coffee tasters with about 10 different blends and roasts, all highly caffeinated.  If you thought Starbucks is expensive, Kona coffee is almost twice that for the beans.  Apparently the climate and elevation is ideal.

Throughout the day, no matter where we were, there was always the sound of ocean waves.  Sometimes the crash of the waves was followed by the low rumbling of rocks rolling under the current.  Back at the base I always find the sound powerful but calming at the same time.
