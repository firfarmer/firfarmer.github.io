In the six weeks Iâ€™ve been in Kona, I had not had a meal off the base.  Last night, Bryan and Betty took me out for a great seafood dinner.  I had uncooked ahi tuna on a bed of corn chips with a special sauce, called Poke Nachos.  It was wonderful as was the company.  Of course, we dined in the outdoor patio.  Not sure why anyone would eat indoors in this climate.  For one thing, they always seem to run A/C indoors which makes it too cold for my liking.
