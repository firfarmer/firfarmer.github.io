YWAM has two campuses in Kona about 1 mile apart.  The main campus is called University of the Nations and the smaller is called YWAM Ships.  UN has up to 1000 students from around the world preparing to be involved in Christian missions.  YWAM Ships has fewer than 100 people on base but many more out on the ships to provide humanitarian aid while sharing the gospel. I’m staying at the YWAM Ships base.  The pictures make it look newer than it is.  The DTS students here share a room with sometimes 2 or more bunk beds in a room.  I’m fortunate to have a room to myself.  My room is overlooking the pool and I can see the beach from the balcony.

I’ve arrived during transition week.  The last DTS (Discipleship Training School) went on their outreach just prior to my arrival and the new students do not arrive until Friday.  Many staff members are also taking a break this week.  The director will return this coming Monday (4/10).  It will be up to him to help direct my efforts.  I look forward to talking to the various teams to understand their pain points.  The teams include accounting,  communications, crew services, fleet support, medical recruitment, procurement. volunteer services, and training services.  Each team has different needs when it comes to using enterprise applications.
