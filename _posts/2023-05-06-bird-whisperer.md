Bryan helps with logistics as a staff member at the base.  He has developed a reciprocal relationship with two brightly colored Saffron Finches.  Every meal time they show up on a nearby railing or chair talking to Bryan in their bird language, telling him it is time to be fed. Bryan spreads bird seed on the ground and the couple is quick to partake along with a few sparrows and doves.  Sometimes there are too many birds looking for a free meal and so Bryan will walk down the path a ways.  The finches will follow right behind always able to discern Bryan from all the other people.  The other birds are not as smart and get left behind.  Once away, Bryan feeds the finches who are then are able to peck the seed without competition.
