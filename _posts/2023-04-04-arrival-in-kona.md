This morning I woke up to a blanket of snow.  This had been the case for the last few days; snow overnight and melting away during the 50 degree days.  The Cascades have been painted white throughout the winter and don’t seem to know it is now spring.  I normally perform chores while absorbing the landscape in the early morning hours but this morning I have a plane to catch.  I did fill the bird feeders, however.

I drive to the boys house in Redmond where Kevin will give me a ride to the airport.  Within a mile of the house the car begins to sputter and can barely keep an idle.  More on that later.  We limp back to the house and use Kevin’s car instead.  Fortunately we are leaving with plenty of time before the flight and as it turns out, the flight is delayed an hour in any case.

The flight is 6.5 hours.  I sleep and watch Jason Bourne movies which I pre-downloaded from Netflix.  Jason Bourne is amazing.  He never misses and he never gets hurt.  He knows umpteen languages.  It is unfortunate that everyone wants to kill him.  Upon landing at Kona there is no enclosed building, just open spaces with some covered areas.  As soon as we de-board the plane, a torrential rainstorm hits.  You are drenched within 30 seconds but the temps are in the 70’s and it’s actually quite pleasant.  Ben drew the short straw and has been assigned to pick me up and after some phone calling and waving of arms we find each other.  Ben works in communications (e.g. website maintenance) and has been a staff member at YWAM Kona for the past 5 years.  At the base, there is a wedding reception going on as two staff members got married that day.  This happens periodically when guys and gals are working every day together. I keep my distance from the festivities as I don't know anyone yet.  Plus, I'm just not as happy about the event as everyone else seems to be.  Instead I go on an exploratory walk along the main boulevard and capture the sunset so I can put it in my blog for today.  End of day 1.
